\section{Usage and compilation}

We will now describe how to compile and use the supplied software, so
that you may experiment with it later when the solution is described.

The source code may be downloaded at the following two addresses,

\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/leksak/kilobyte.git} \\
\url{git@github.com:leksak/kilobyte.git}
\end{center}

on the institution's network.

For the duration of this report the directory created by cloning
the repository is referred to as the \emph{root directory}.

\section{Compilation and usage}

is the usage of the software

\subsection{Compilation}

Whilst there execute the following command to compile the program:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=plain]
$ gradle simulatorJar
\end{lstlisting}

You will require Gradle 3.2.1, which is available for
\href{http://gradle.org/gradle-download/}{download here}, or
executable through
\tt{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\mathtt{\sim}$}filip/bin/gradle}
on the institution's network.

In the \tt{build/libs} directory you will now find a file named
