\subsubsection{Example: Mnemonic decoding}

Assuming you know how a particular instruction is represented in its
mnemonic form then performing the reverse operation, i.e. translating from
a human-legible form to the numerical form, is trivial.

Take for instance \tt{div \$t2, \$t4}. We know that its mnemonic
representation is patternized thusly,

\begin{lstlisting}[style=mips_lst]
div $rs, $rt
\end{lstlisting}
%$

We know the \opcode{} and the \funct{}, and from the pattern and the
format of the instruction we infer that both the \shamt{} and the
\rd{} fields have to be zero.

Since we know how to interpret the symbolic names of the registers
numerically we may now compose the numeric representation of the
instruction which is as follows,

\begin{figure}[H]
  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto,
    every node/.style={rectangle, minimum height=2.5em, text centered, text width=6em, text height=1.5ex, text depth=.25ex},
    field/.style={draw}]
\matrix (m) [ampersand replacement=\&, column sep=-\pgflinewidth, row sep=-\pgflinewidth]
{
\node [field] {$\textrm{B}_{31\textrm{-}26}$}; \&
\node [field] {$\textrm{B}_{25\textrm{-}21}$}; \&
\node [field] {$\textrm{B}_{20\textrm{-}16}$}; \&
\node [field] {$\textrm{B}_{15\textrm{-}11}$}; \&
\node [field] {$\textrm{B}_{10\textrm{-}6}$}; \&
\node [field] {$\textrm{B}_{5\textrm{-}0}$}; \&
\\
\node [field] {0}; \&
\node [field] {10}; \&
\node [field] {12}; \&
\node [field] {0}; \&
\node [field] {0}; \&
\node [field] {0x1a}; \&
\\
};
\end{tikzpicture}
  }
\end{figure}

and the final translation step, and the resulting numerical
representation, is given by a sequence of bit-shift operations, in
this case the following will serve,\footnote{No operations are
  required for the zeroes.}\footnote{Notice that the shift amount (21,
  16) corresponds directly to the lower most bit of the respective fields (rs, rt)}

\begin{lstlisting}
(10 << 21) | (12 << 16) | 0x1a
\end{lstlisting}

which is equal to \tt{0x014c001a}.
